            <p class="words-start">
                Pokémon Star (pronounced Pokémon Star) are a type of Pokémon found in the 
                Pokémon Trading Card Game that depict the alternate color variation of a Pokémon.
            </p>
            <p class="words">
                First introduced in the EX Team Rocket Returns expansion, Pokémon Star saw the 
                return of Shining/Alternate Color Pokémon after their brief appearance in the Neo 
                Revelation and Neo Destiny expansions. While they were still bound by the 1-per 
                deck rule, they no longer featured multiple energy-type attacks (with the exception 
                of Latias, Latios and Rayquaza from EX Deoxys) and often had very beneficial 
                attacks, making them much more playable.
            </p>
            <p class="words">
                Their card design, like that of Pokémon-ex is also unique. The character art 
                depicts the Pokémon with portions of their body protruding outside of the character 
                window, almost as if they are "jumping out" of the card. Various areas of the card 
                design have golden tinges added to it, such as the corners of the attack text box 
                and character window; the shadows of these graphics are also holographic.
            </p>
            <p class="words">
                Like their predecessors, these cards were still difficult to obtain, the odds of 
                finding one roughly 1 in 2 booster boxes, sending their prices soaring. By far the 
                most valuable Pokémon Star are the Japanese versions of the Eeveelutions, which were 
                awarded as tiered prize cards to members of the Pokémon Players Club. Complete sets
                and the higher tier cards still command high prices. Their subsequent English release 
                in the EX Power Keepers expansion and POP Series 5 promotional set saw their initial 
                demand decrease, though the Japanese World Champions Pack reprints of Vaporeon Star, 
                Jolteon Star, and Flareon Star proved more popular than their original prints due 
                to the distribution method of the set.
            </p>
            <p class="words">
                δ Delta Species Pokémon Star are always the type that their alternate-colored form 
                takes on the color of. For example, Gyarados Star δ is a Fire-type because Shiny Gyarados are red.
            </p>   
            <p class="words">
                All Pokémon Star are Basic Pokémon, and all Pokémon Star cards are illustrated by Masakazu Fukuda.
            </p>
            <p class="words">
                In the Diamond & Pearl expansion, Pokémon Star and Pokémon-ex were essentially jointly
                replaced by Pokémon LV.X, though Shiny Pokémon were again featured in the TCG in the 
                Stormfront expansion. However, they received no special rules, multi-Energy attacks or visual 
                enhancements. Their only difference from regular cards this time around was a special "starry"
                foil reminiscent of early English foil treatments (in Japan), or a unique collection number 
                with the prefix "SH" (outside Japan). This change perhaps reflects that in the Pokémon games, 
                Shiny Pokémon are no different to normal Pokémon, other than that they are a different color.

                    points could be earned, the Japanese print of this card was extremely difficult to obtain.

                    This card was released in POP Series 5, first released as one of the Japanese
                    PLAY Promotional cards. In Japan, it was made available by the Daisuki Pokémon
                    Fan Club from 2005 to 2006. To obtain this card, members needed to accumulate
                    70,000 points through various meets and activities. Due to the relatively short
                    time frame that points could be earned, the Japanese print of this card was 
                    extremely difficult to obtain.
